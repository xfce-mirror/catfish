    <_p>
    Catfish is a small, fast, and powerful file search utility. Featuring a
    minimal interface with an emphasis on results, it helps users find the files
    they need without a file manager. With powerful filters such as modification
    date, file type, and file contents, users will no longer be dependent on the
    file manager or organization skills.
