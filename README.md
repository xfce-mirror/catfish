# Catfish

Catfish is a handy file searching tool for Linux and Unix. 
The interface is intentionally lightweight and simple, using only GTK+3. 
You can configure it to your needs by using several command line options.

You are encouraged to run ``catfish â€“help`` to check out the various command line options.
